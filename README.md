# SAIntegrityCheck
Integrity check for GTA: San Andreas

The purpouse of this program is to ensure players that their copies of GTA: San Andreas have the standard files and aren't modified to affect the gameplay in any way that could provide unexpected advantages or other kinds of differences. 

This is important because in SA-MP it is common for people to obtain their copies of the game from sites that could be providing modified copies of the game. This might sound like bull, but it is a lot more common than you might think.

To run the check, simply place SAIntegrityCheck.exe inside your GTA: San Andreas folder and run it.

Languages available: Spanish, English.

Building: Just compile the .pas file with Free Pascal Compiler and default options.
